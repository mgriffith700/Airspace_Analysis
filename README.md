# Airspace_Analysis
I created a jupyter notebook using Python version 3.7.9 to download a csv dataset from Airspace's github repository.
I used python to manipulate and analyze the data, creating several new tables and graphs to visualize important data points. 
The notebook shows the methods and skills I would use to analyze, enhance, and pull useful information from a dataset.
At several places in the notebook I printed a subset (5-10 rows) of a dataframe to prevent the whole dataset from appearing in the notebook.
To run the notebook and generate the full dataframes, simply remove .head() from the dataframe callout
Example: order_count.head(10).style.hide_index().set_precision(2) -> order_count.style.hide_index().set_precision(2)

Github will render a static version of the jupyter notebook here in the repository. 
To run/test the notebook either download the file from this github repo or visit
