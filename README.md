# Airspace_Analysis
I created a jupyter notebook using Python version 3.7.9 to download a csv dataset from Airspace's github repository.
I used python to manipulate and analyze the data, creating several new tables and graphs to visualize important data points. 
The notebook shows the methods and skills I would use to analyze, enhance, and pull useful information from a dataset.
